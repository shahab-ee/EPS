# Engineering Probability & Statistics

This course provides a foundation in probability and statistical methods essential for engineers. Students will learn key concepts such as:

Probability theory: Random variables, probability distributions (discrete and continuous), joint and conditional probabilities, expectation, and variance.
Descriptive statistics: Data summarization, visualization, and exploratory data analysis.
Statistical inference: Estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
Applications: Application of these concepts to solve engineering problems, such as reliability analysis, quality control, signal processing, and data science.
# The course includes hands-on projects using Python to reinforce learning and develop practical skills in data analysis and statistical modeling.

This course typically involves a combination of lectures, problem-solving sessions, and potentially laboratory work.
